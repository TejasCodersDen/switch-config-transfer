# switch-config-transfer

This is a project I am working on while pursing my Master's in Computer Science at Santa Clara University.

The task is simple; write a script to transfer interface configurations from old Cisco 3850s to new 9300s. 
Types of devices connected to our college server would be Student Personal devices (Laptops, PS, etc), VOIPs, APs, Office Computers.

End result: succesfully transfer configurations from over 500 switches.
